I'm a Kubernetes Engineer at VMWare, and have worked on K8s (core) since
its inception in 2015 as an open source project.  

Currently my major open source work is aligned with K8s and the VMWare Tanzu project.

In my former life, I've: 
- served as the Engineering lead, at blackduck (Synopsys), moving a 100 million dollar SaaS to the Cloud on K8s
- worked on core scheduling, api, e2e, and performance features Kubernetes core at Red Hat.
- consulted for Universities, publically traded companies, and startups - moving them towards scalable, microservice and cloud based solutions that deliver immediate value.
- Am a member, PMC, and commiter of the ASF, contributing to projects such as Bigtop, hadoop, spark, storm, and Ctakes.

Reach out to me about collaborating on stuff anytime!
