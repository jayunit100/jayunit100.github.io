# communication rules to prevent descending into a world of big corporation apathy

PRs welcome 

- Say hello to people when you join work for the day, and say goodbye when you leave
- Always clarify who "we" is so there's no ownership ambiguety.
- If your org uses JIRA, then get the contract in JIRA -  or it doesnt count. 
- Overcommunicate links to documents.  People dont bookmark everything you dump in zoom.  
  - Have a landing page for your team so you dont have to keep posting the same links over and over. 
- Defer to TLs to make decisions even if theyre obvious, to create a culture where individuals and teams own things.
- Screen share the whole time.  Even if its mtng notes. 
  - Buy a 2nd monitor if you have to.  Dont force 10 people to click on a URL all at once and fumble around.
- If your taking about code.  Show the code. 
- Use public slacks, so that you can easily share the channel as part of your screen sharing. 
- Dont be too raise-handy .  This isnt school. People don't normally talk that way in real life.
- Turn your camera on, or at least acknowledge that your camera is off.  Don't create a culture of zoom spying.
  - Camera fatigue? Leave quickly, dont linger in a meeting your not able to contribute to.
- Ask people to turn their cameras on
- Take notes and dump them in slack so folks not in the mtng dont get FOMO.  
  - This is important to counterbalance the cameras rule: If people feel theyre missing out on info, they might feel pressure
to join while taking their kids to school.  Dont create unnecessary meeting pressure.
