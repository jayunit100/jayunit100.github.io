I'm a Kubernetes Engineer at VMWare, and has worked on K8s at its core since
its inception in 2015 as an open source project.  Currently my major open source
work is aligned with K8s and the VMWare Tanzu project.

In my former life, I've: 
- served as the Engineering lead, at blackduck (Synopsys), moving a 100 million dollar SaaS to the Cloud on K8s
- worked on core scheduling, api, e2e, and performance features Kubernetes core at Red Hat.
- consulted for Universities, publically traded companies, and startups - moving them towards scalable, microservice and cloud based solutions that deliver immediate value.

Reach out to me about collaborating on stuff anytime!
